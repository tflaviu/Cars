The Toyota Yaris (Japanese: ??? ·??? Toyota Yarisu?) is a subcompact car produced by Toyota since 1999, replacing the Starlet.

Between 1999 and 2005, some markets received the same vehicles under the Toyota Echo name. Toyota has used the "Yaris" and "Echo" names on the export version of several different Japanese-market models. The name "Yaris" is derived from "Charis", the singular form of Charites, the Greek goddesses of charm and beauty.[1]
